Focus on the shape and length of the stem to help in classifying the images of the oranges. The 'A' orange has a green stem that has a longer length than the 'B' orange.
You can classify the orange as 'A' if the stem is green colored and you can classify the orange 'B' if they have more black in their stem.
Alternatively, you can clasisfy the orange as 'A' if it has a clearly protruding stem while you can classify the orange 'B' if the stem is very flat and not protruding.
