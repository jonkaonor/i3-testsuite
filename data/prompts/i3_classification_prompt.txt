To differentiate between the classes of images based on the characteristics of the oranges, consider the following features:

1. **Label A:**
   - **Texture:** The texture of the orange peel is notably textured, with a moderate amount of shine, suggesting a natural light reflection on a slightly rough surface.
   - **Color:** The orange displays a consistent vibrant orange hue across its surface.
   - **Stem Presence:** The stem area appears slightly recessed and is not prominently visible.

2. **Label B:**
   - **Texture:** The texture of this orange appears more smooth compared to Label A, with a slightly glossy finish that indicates a smoother peel.
   - **Color:** The color of this orange is similar to Label A, with a consistent orange tone, but it might have marginally less saturation due to lighting.
   - **Stem Presence:** The stem is more prominently visible and slightly elevated, contrasting with the rest of the surface.

By focusing on these distinctions, such as the texture smoothness and stem prominence, one can effectively classify images of oranges into the respective classes.
