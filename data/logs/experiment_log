Task Input Text: Please learn to classify these images of oranges from the following labeled training set images and then classify the unlabeled test set images.
You will be shown a labeled training example  of each possible orange in the test set as training set images. 
You will then be shown unlabeled test examples of the same oranges from the training set  in different environments, your job is to correctly guess which orange from the training set the orange is.  
The answer format should first have the text 'Answers:' followed by the classification label of each test set orange  with answers separated by commas followed by a space on a single line.
For the first answer, leave a space between the colon in 'Answers:' and the answer itself. 
Then add an empty line and give an explanation for your answers in the format  'Reasoning: Your response'.

Input Context Text: Focus on the shape and length of the stem to help in classifying the images of the oranges. The 'A' orange has a green stem that has a longer length than the 'B' orange.
You can classify the orange as 'A' if the stem is green colored and you can classify the orange 'B' if they have more black in their stem.
Alternatively, you can clasisfy the orange as 'A' if it has a clearly protruding stem while you can classify the orange 'B' if the stem is very flat and not protruding.

Input Context Text: Focus on the shape and length of the stem to help in classifying the images of the oranges. The 'A' orange has a green stem that has a longer length than the 'B' orange.
You can classify the orange as 'A' if the stem is green colored and you can classify the orange 'B' if they have more black in their stem.
Alternatively, you can clasisfy the orange as 'A' if it has a clearly protruding stem while you can classify the orange 'B' if the stem is very flat and not protruding.

Reasoning:  
I used the stem color and protrusion to classify each orange.  
1. Test 1 – green, protruding stem → A  
2. Test 2 – green, protruding stem → A  
3. Test 3 – stem is flat and darker → B  
4. Test 4 – clearly protruding green stem → A  
5. Test 5 – low, darker stem flush with rind → B  
6. Test 6 – long green stem, like training A → A  
7. Test 7 – very flat, dark stem area → B  
8. Test 8 – bright green, prominently protruding → A

Reasoning: Each test image shows an orange with a green and clearly protruding stem, which matches the characteristics of the 'A' orange from the training set. None of the images exhibit the flat, more black-colored stem that is associated with the 'B' orange. Thus, all test images are classified as 'A'.

Task Input Text: Please learn to classify these images of oranges from the following labeled training set images and then classify the unlabeled test set images.
You will be shown a labeled training example  of each possible orange in the test set as training set images. 
You will then be shown unlabeled test examples of the same oranges from the training set  in different environments, your job is to correctly guess which orange from the training set the orange is.  
The answer format should first have the text 'Answers:' followed by the classification label of each test set orange  with answers separated by commas followed by a space on a single line.
For the first answer, leave a space between the colon in 'Answers:' and the answer itself. 
Then add an empty line and give an explanation for your answers in the format  'Reasoning: Your response'.


Input Context Text: Focus on the shape and length of the stem to help in classifying the images of the oranges. The 'A' orange has a green stem that has a longer length than the 'B' orange.
You can classify the orange as 'A' if the stem is green colored and you can classify the orange 'B' if they have more black in their stem.
Alternatively, you can clasisfy the orange as 'A' if it has a clearly protruding stem while you can classify the orange 'B' if the stem is very flat and not protruding.
