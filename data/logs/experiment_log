System Prompt Text: You are a virtual assistant tasked with solving a problem after being shown some training examples of how to solve the problem. You should 
always output your response in the specified output format and you should always attempt to solve the task problem.

Task Input Text: Please learn to classify these images of oranges from the following labeled training set images and then classify the unlabeled test set images.
You will be shown a labeled training example  of each possible orange in the test set as training set images. 
You will then be shown unlabeled test examples of the same oranges from the training set  in different environments, your job is to correctly guess which orange from the training set the orange is.  
The answer format should first have the text 'Answers:' followed by the classification label of each test set orange  with answers separated by commas followed by a space on a single line.
For the first answer, leave a space between the colon in 'Answers:' and the answer itself. 
Then add an empty line and give an explanation for your answers in the format  'Reasoning: Your response'.

Input Context Text: Focus on the shape and length of the stem to help in classifying the images of the oranges. The 'A' orange has a green stem that has a longer length than the 'B' orange.
You can classify the orange as 'A' if the stem is green colored and you can classify the orange 'B' if they have more black in their stem.
Alternatively, you can clasisfy the orange as 'A' if it has a clearly protruding stem while you can classify the orange 'B' if the stem is very flat and not protruding.

Total Tokens Used: 3337
Model Response: Answers: A, A, A, A, B, A, B, A

Reasoning: 
1. The first test image has a green and clearly protruding stem, indicating it belongs to class 'A'.
2. The second test image also shows a green, more protruding stem, classifying it as 'A'.
3. The third test image features a green stem that protrudes, thus it's 'A'.
4. The fourth test image displays a green stem, which is more extended, indicating 'A'.
5. The fifth test image has a flat, darker stem, consistent with class 'B'.
6. The sixth test image shows a longer, protruding green stem, indicating 'A'.
7. The seventh test image has a darker and less protruding stem, suggesting it belongs to class 'B'.
8. The eighth test image has a green and protruding stem, indicating it is 'A'.

Train Prompt Text: # Instructions 

*Please use the following labeled images from the training set to create an in-depth textual description of the images in general and the  distinguishing differences between the different classes of images.
*This textual description is a 'classification prompt' that will be used to aid a LLM in classifying unlabeled test images later.  
*The format of your answer should begin with the string 'Classification Prompt:' followed the textual description of the class differences.

i3 Context Text: *Focus only on characteristics of the orange for the purposes of generating the classification prompt and for distinguishing between the image classifications.
*Do not focus on the background, lighting or other environmental factor.
Total Tokens Used: 924
Model Response: Classification Prompt:

Class A Oranges:
- The oranges exhibit a vibrant and uniform orange hue.
- They have a particularly glossy surface appearance with noticeable shine or highlights, reflecting light prominently.
- The texture is smooth but clearly shows a fine, detailed dimple pattern on the peel.
- The stem area is more recessed, with a small, visible green stem.

Class B Oranges: 
- These oranges display a deep orange color with subtle variations in shading across the surface.
- The surface is less shiny and has a matte appearance, reflecting less light compared to Class A.
- The texture is slightly rougher with a broader and less distinct dimple pattern.
- The stem area appears slightly protruding and the stem may not be as visibly pronounced. 

Use these characteristics to differentiate between Class A and Class B images when classifying new images.

Test Prompt Text: # Instructions

* Please classify the following unlabeled test set images by utilizing the distinguishing information in the classification prompt and the labeled training images.
* You will be shown labeled training examples of each possible class of image in the test set as training images.
* You will then be shown unlabeled test examples of the same classes of images in different environments.
* Your job is to correctly guess the class of image for each unlabeled test example.
* Your answers should be in the following format. First the string 'Answers:' should appear followed by your predicted classification label for each test set image. Your predicted classifications should be separated by commas followed by a space. All predicted classification answers should be on a single line. After this line, add an empty line and give an explanation for your predicted classifications following the string 'Reasoning: Your reasoning'.
* For the first answer, leave a space between the colon in 'Answers:' and the first predicted class.
