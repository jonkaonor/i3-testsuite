Task Input Text: Please learn to classify these images of oranges from the following labeled training set images and then classify the unlabeled test set images.
You will be shown a labeled training example  of each possible orange in the test set as training set images. 
You will then be shown unlabeled test examples of the same oranges from the training set  in different environments, your job is to correctly guess which orange from the training set the orange is.  
The answer format should first have the text 'Answers:' followed by the classification label of each test set orange  with answers separated by commas followed by a space on a single line.
For the first answer, leave a space between the colon in 'Answers:' and the answer itself. 
Then add an empty line and give an explanation for your answers in the format  'Reasoning: Your response'.


Input Context Text: Focus on the shape and length of the stem to help in classifying the images of the oranges. The 'A' orange has a green stem that has a longer length than the 'B' orange.
You can classify the orange as 'A' if the stem is green colored and you can classify the orange 'B' if they have more black in their stem.
Alternatively, you can clasisfy the orange as 'A' if it has a clearly protruding stem while you can classify the orange 'B' if the stem is very flat and not protruding.

Reasoning: The classification was based on the color and prominence of the stem in each image. Oranges labeled 'A' have a green, protruding stem, while those labeled 'B' have a flatter, darker stem.

1. The first test image shows a protruding green stem, consistent with orange 'A'.
2. The second test image also has a clear, green stem, indicating orange 'A'.
3. The third test image has a stem that appears flatter and darker, pointing to orange 'B'.
4. The fourth test image similarly shows a flat, darker stem, classifying it as 'B'.
5. The fifth test image has a flat, dark stem, matching orange 'B'.
6. The sixth test image has a green and protruding stem, identifying it as orange 'A'.
7. The seventh test image features a clear, green stem, also matching orange 'A'.
8. The eighth test image has a flatter and darker stem, classifying it as 'B'.

Reasoning: The classification is based on the stem characteristics of the oranges. 

1. First test image: A, because it has a clearly protruding and lengthy green stem.
2. Second test image: B, because it has a flatter and darker stem.
3. Third test image: A, due to the presence of a green, visible stem.
4. Fourth test image: A, with a green protruding stem.
5. Fifth test image: A, because the stem is green and prominent.
6. Sixth test image: A, showing a green stem that stands out.
7. Seventh test image: B, as the stem is darker and more recessed.
8. Eighth test image: A, featuring a clearly protruding green stem.

Reasoning: The classifications are based on the stem characteristics described. Oranges labeled as 'A' from the training set have a clearly protruding, green stem. Oranges labeled as 'B' have a flatter, darker stem.

1. **Test image 1**: The stem is relatively flat and darker, classifying it as 'B'.
2. **Test image 2**: Similarly, this also shows a flatter, darker stem, classifying it as 'B'.
3. **Test image 3**: The protruding, green stem is visible, classifying it as 'A'.
4. **Test image 4**: Another visible green stem, classifying it as 'A'.
5. **Test image 5**: Shows a flatter, less pronounced stem, classifying it as 'B'.
6. **Test image 6**: Clearly protruding green stem, classifying it as 'A'.
7. **Test image 7**: The visible green stem suggests it should be classified as 'A'.
8. **Test image 8**: Protruding green stem is evident, classifying it as 'A'.

Reasoning: 
1. The first test orange shows a clearly protruding green stem similar to training A, so it’s A.  
2. The second orange’s stem is very flat with a pale green/blackish ring and no protrusion—matches training B, so it’s B.  
3. The third orange has a distinct, raised green stem like the A example, so it’s A.  
4. The fourth image on the black leather seat shows a protruding green nub, consistent with A.  
5. The fifth orange’s stem is almost flush and darkish—flat like B.  
6. The sixth orange also has a very flat, low‐profile stem with darker tones—B.  
7. The seventh orange on the wooden table has a flat stem without protrusion and a dark center—B.  
8. The eighth orange on the carpet has a recessed, darkish stem ring—B.
