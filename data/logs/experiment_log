Reasoning: 

1. **Test Image 1**: Matches training image **A**; the texture and stem position are similar.
2. **Test Image 2**: Matches training image **B**; this orange's texture and lighting resemble image B's characteristics.
3. **Test Image 3**: Matches training image **B**; the light sheen and texture align with orange B.
4. **Test Image 4**: Matches training image **A**; the skin texture and lighting make it appear similar to image A.
5. **Test Image 5**: Matches training image **B**; the color and overall appearance closely resemble image B.
6. **Test Image 6**: Matches training image **B**; the consistent lighting and texture suggest it's B.
7. **Test Image 7**: Matches training image **B**; the position and texture resemble orange B.
8. **Test Image 8**: Matches training image **B**; similar lighting and texture are evident.

Input Context Text: Focus on the shape and length of the stem to help in classifying the images of the oranges. The 'A' orange has a green stem that has a longer length than the 'B' orange.
You can classify the orange as 'A' if the stem is green colored and you can classify the orange 'B' if they have more black in their stem.
Alternatively, you can clasisfy the orange as 'A' if it has a clearly protruding stem while you can classify the orange 'B' if the stem is very flat and not protruding.

Reasoning: 
1. **First Image**: The stem is green and clearly protruding, indicating it is 'A'.
2. **Second Image**: Similar to the first test image, it has a green, protruding stem, indicating 'A'.
3. **Third Image**: Displays the same green and protruding stem characteristics as 'A'.
4. **Fourth Image**: Again, the stem is green with noticeable protrusion, classifying it as 'A'.
5. **Fifth Image**: The stem appears more flat and has a darker color, leading to classification as 'B'.
6. **Sixth Image**: The stem looks flat and dark, it fits the characteristics of 'B'.
7. **Seventh Image**: The green stem is protruding, indicating 'A'.
8. **Eighth Image**: This last image shows the green and protruding stem, classifying it as 'A'.

Train Prompt Text: # Instructions 

*Please use the following labeled images from the training set to create an in-depth textual description of the images in general and the  distinguishing differences between the different classes of images.
*This textual description is a 'classification prompt' that will be used to aid a LLM in classifying unlabeled test images later.  
*The format of your answer should begin with the string 'Classification Prompt:' followed the textual description of the class differences.

i3 Context Text: *Focus only on characteristics of the orange for the purposes of generating the classification prompt and for distinguishing between the image classifications.
*Do not focus on the background, lighting or other environmental factor.

Model Response: Classification Prompt:

To differentiate between the classes of images based on the characteristics of the oranges, consider the following features:

1. **Label A:**
   - **Texture:** The texture of the orange peel is notably textured, with a moderate amount of shine, suggesting a natural light reflection on a slightly rough surface.
   - **Color:** The orange displays a consistent vibrant orange hue across its surface.
   - **Stem Presence:** The stem area appears slightly recessed and is not prominently visible.

2. **Label B:**
   - **Texture:** The texture of this orange appears more smooth compared to Label A, with a slightly glossy finish that indicates a smoother peel.
   - **Color:** The color of this orange is similar to Label A, with a consistent orange tone, but it might have marginally less saturation due to lighting.
   - **Stem Presence:** The stem is more prominently visible and slightly elevated, contrasting with the rest of the surface.

By focusing on these distinctions, such as the texture smoothness and stem prominence, one can effectively classify images of oranges into the respective classes.

Test Prompt Text: # Instructions

* Please classify the following unlabeled test set images by utilizing the distinguishing information in the classification prompt and the labeled training images.
* You will be shown labeled training examples of each possible class of image in the test set as training images.
* You will then be shown unlabeled test examples of the same classes of images in different environments.
* Your job is to correctly guess the class of image for each unlabeled test example.
* Your answers should be in the following format. First the string 'Answers:' should appear followed by your predicted classification label for each test set image. Your predicted classifications should be separated by commas followed by a space. All predicted classification answers should be on a single line. After this line, add an empty line and give an explanation for your predicted classifications following the string 'Reasoning: Your reasoning'.
* For the first answer, leave a space between the colon in 'Answers:' and the first predicted class.

Reasoning: The classification is based on the texture and stem presence of the oranges:

1. **Image 1:** The orange has a smoother texture and a prominent stem, indicative of Label B.
2. **Image 2:** This orange also exhibits a smooth texture and a visible stem, classifying it as Label B.
3. **Image 3:** The orange displays a more textured surface with a recessed stem, matching Label A.
4. **Image 4:** Similar to Image 1 and 2, this shows a smooth finish and clear stem, suggesting Label B.
5. **Image 5:** The orange has a textured surface with recessed stem, characteristic of Label A.
6. **Image 6:** The peel is textured and the stem is less prominent, corresponding to Label A.
7. **Image 7:** Features a smoother finish with a visible, raised stem, indicating Label B.
8. **Image 8:** The orange shows smoother texture and elevated stem, aligning with Label B.
