Task Input Text: Please learn to classify these images of oranges from the following labeled training set images and then classify the unlabeled test set images.
You will be shown a labeled training example  of each possible orange in the test set as training set images. 
You will then be shown unlabeled test examples of the same oranges from the training set  in different environments, your job is to correctly guess which orange from the training set the orange is.  
The answer format should first have the text 'Answers:' followed by the classification label of each test set orange  with answers separated by commas followed by a space on a single line.
For the first answer, leave a space between the colon in 'Answers:' and the answer itself. 
Then add an empty line and give an explanation for your answers in the format  'Reasoning: Your response'.


Input Context Text: Focus on the shape and length of the stem to help in classifying the images of the oranges. The 'A' orange has a green stem that has a longer length than the 'B' orange.
You can classify the orange as 'A' if the stem is green colored and you can classify the orange 'B' if they have more black in their stem.
Alternatively, you can clasisfy the orange as 'A' if it has a clearly protruding stem while you can classify the orange 'B' if the stem is very flat and not protruding.

Reasoning: The main differentiating features between the oranges are the color and protrusion of the stem. 
- Test 1 has a more blackish, flat stem similar to training image B, so it is classified as B.
- Test 2 has a green, protruding stem, characteristic of orange A.
- Test 3 has a green, visibly protruding stem, matching orange A.
- Test 4 also shows a green, protruding stem, indicating it as orange A.
- Test 5 has a green, extending stem, classifying it as A.
- Test 6 presents a green, larger protruding stem characteristic of A.
- Test 7 features a less protruding stem with more dark color similar to B, hinting at an 'A', but the black part is more visibly dominant.
- Test 8 has a blackish, flat stem similar to orange B.

Reasoning: The classification is based on the distinct surface texture, background, and lighting observed in the images. 

1. **Test Image 1:** The texture and appearance closely match the characteristics of training image B, with similar lighting and subtle features of the skin.
2. **Test Image 2:** The dark environment and texture are consistent with training image A, which is similar to the setting of the test image.
3. **Test Image 3:** This image shares the bright environment and smoother texture visible in training image A.
4. **Test Image 4:** The wood-patterned surface resembles the environment of training image A.
5. **Test Image 5:** Although the background lighting is different, the skin texture is similar to training image A.
6. **Test Image 6:** The carpeted texture and lighting closely match training image B.
7. **Test Image 7:** The smooth surface and lighting environment are consistent with training image A.
8. **Test Image 8:** The varied lighting in the image is more similar to the characteristics of training image A.
